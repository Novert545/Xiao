    I am not the only traveler
    Who has not repaid his debt
    I've been searching for a trail to 
    follow again
    Take me back to the night we met

    And then I can tell myself
    What the hell I'm supposed to do
    And then I can tell myself
    Not to ride along with you

    I had all and then most of you
    Some and now none of you
    Take me back to the night we met
    I don't know what I'm supposed to do
    Haunted by the ghost of you
    Oh, take me back to the night we met

    When the night was full of terrors
    And your eyes were filled with tears
    When you had not touched me yet
    Oh, take me back to the night we met

    I had all and then most of you
    Some and now none of you
    Take me back to the night we met
    I don't know what I'm supposed to do
    Haunted by the ghost of you
    Take me back to the night we met
           
<h4>    Something I made just for you
    -Jhet
